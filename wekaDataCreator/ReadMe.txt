This project converts a text file of keystroke data into a corresponding .arff file for weka.
In the sample "input.txt" file there are data from 5 different emotional states (). If you use different data sets consisting of different classes other
than this sample, please open the source code and go to line 58 and set your class names accordingly.
After running the code "output.arff" file will be generated.
To run the "output.arff" file with weka, open it with weka explorer. And run with your desired classifier.
